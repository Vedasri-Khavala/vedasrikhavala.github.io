Industrial effluent degradation is complicated compared to commercially available pollutants (dyes) like methylene blue, methylene orange, rhodamine B, etc. This study mainly focuses on the industrial titanium dioxide produced from ilmenite using a modified sulfate process. This modified sulfate process derived-titanium dioxide (mspd-TiO2) is used to degrade real industrial wastewater by photocatalysis. This approach can potentially address the scalability and cost-related challenges associated with using analytical grade TiO2 for wastewater treatment. The mspd-TiO2 is characterized and compared with the commercially available Degussa P-25 TiO2 and tested. Industrial effluent is characterized before and after degradation. The spectroscopy data confirmed that industrial wastewater contains Sulfur Black and Acid Orange 7 pollutants. The quantitative and qualitative CHNS analysis showed that the industrial effluent contains high sulfur (S= 11.37±0.15%) along with organic compounds. The organo-sulfur compounds in the industrial effluent are degraded nonetheless using photocatalysis with mspd-TiO2. This study showed 80±3% sulfur black and 72±3% acid orange7 degradation in the industrial wastewater within 2h with a concentration of 150g/l TiO2 at pH of 5 (k= 0.0125±0.002 min-1). The post-analysis of industrial wastewater with reaction pathways for both Sulfur Black and Acid Orange 7 has been proposed with kinetics at different pH values. The FT-IR and CHNS analysis results confirmed that the sulfur and organic compounds are degraded significantly.
