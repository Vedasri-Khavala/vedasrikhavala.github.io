title: Experimental investigation on Kinetic Aspects of Natural Gas Hydrates for Heavy Metal Salt Desalination
subtitle: Supervised by Dr.Rajnish Kumar (Department of Chemical Engineering, IITM) 
---

Application of sludge-free green gas hydrate-based technology for desalination of heavy metals from industrial effluents  
Synthesis of gas hydrates with natural gas and cyclopentane as the hydrate formers from 1000 ppm of individual heavy metal (As5+, Pb2+, Cd2+ and Cr3+) salt solutions  
Kinetics was enhanced in the presence of a benign additive - lecithin.
