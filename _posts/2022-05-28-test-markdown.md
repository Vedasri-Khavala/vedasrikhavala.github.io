- Application of sludge-free green gas hydrate-based technology for desalination of heavy metals from industrial effluents 
- Synthesis of gas hydrates with natural gas and cyclopentane as the hydrate formers from 1000 ppm of individual heavy metal (As5+, Pb2+, Cd2+ and Cr3+) salt solutions
- Kinetics was enhanced in the presence of a benign additive - lecithin.
