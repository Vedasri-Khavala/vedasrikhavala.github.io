title: Entropy of High Entropy Alloys (HEAs)
subtitle: Supervised by Prof.B.S.Murty (Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, IITM)
---

Synthesis of Binary,Ternary, Quaternary and Quinary high entropy alloys by vacuum arc melting
 
Specific heat capacity measurements of the synthesized alloys from 400 to 1400 degree Celcius using a differential scanning caloriemetry
 
Thermodynamic estimation of the specific heat capacity of the HEA systems using Calculation of Phase Diagrams (CALPHAD)
 
Estimation of the nonconfigurational entropy at 1400 degree Celcius with respect to nonconfigurational entropy at 400 degree Celcius
